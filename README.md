# About the project
I wanted to make a project where I can easily reference my notes from anywhere on any platform but this is a work in progress. While I work on finiding out if there's a possiblity of scraping my notes from the YouVersion Bible App API programatically, I'll be adding notes manually. Ultimately, I would like to fabricate new means to create custom queries for key phrases, refs, tags, etc. to pull the data. However, I haven't decided on the method just yet. Once I've had time to create a prototype, document control will be public facing here as the project develops. Along with any additional info, notes and changes that may be useful in those endeavours.


URLs for highlights

This url is an example that I randomly found. I'm assuming that the URI specifies highlight 73 of 240:
