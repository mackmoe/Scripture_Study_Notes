## Scripture: Genesis 1:6-8 NKJV 
Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.

And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years.

### Comments
In the original language, the word for seasons is actually "וּלְמ֣וֹעֲדִ֔ים" (ū-lə-mō-w-‘ă-ḏîm or Strong's 4150 "moed") which is used all over the bible to tell us when his appointed times/feast are. They are special, they are days He set appart that he promised us that we could meet with him.

let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also. God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good.

## Scripture: Genesis 6:1-5
Now it came about, when men began to multiply  on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose. Then the LORD said, "My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, because he also is flesh; nevertheless his days shall be one hundred and twenty years." The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore [children] to them. Those were the mighty men who [were] of old, men of renown. Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. The LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. 7The LORD said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them."

Then the LORD said to Noah, "Enter the ark, you and all your household, for you [alone] I have seen [to be] righteous before Me in this time. "You shall take with you of every clean animal by sevens, a male and his female; and of the animals that are not clean two, a male and his female;

### Comments
How would Noah have known which animals were clean or unclean? This is one of many clear indications (prior to Moses), that God's commandments (the law) weren't established at Mt Sinai. That they must have been established when he first made His covenants with man (Ref Genesis 6:18 for what made Noah righteous in God sight).

##### Comments
Yay! "a servant who is born in the house..." I saw how Jesus says being "born again" ties back into this promise and was blown away. oh yea... circumcision seems like it's a pretty big deal to god. it's mentioned a lot here and throughout the rest of the book. As well as in the last chapters of the next book, also a whole bunch in Leviticus...

## Scripture: Genesis 21:32-33 NASB
So they made a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, arose and returned to the land of the Philistines. Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the Lord , the Everlasting God.

### Comments
Interesting thing, this word " אשל "(eshel) (which here translated as tamarisk) is only used once in the whole Bible. Where it's transliterated as some type of tree (tamarisk) doesn't really fit, because it is not entirely understood why would Abraham randomly plant a tamarisk tree and call on the name of the lord... After looking into this, I found that the idea here, is a play on words where "eshel" is an acronym (3-letters: okel, shethah, shenah) food, drink and sleeping. So in other words, he planted an Inn there and used it to proclaim the God of the Universe to everyone who stops there (which would make much more sense - seeing how hospitable Abraham was to the 3 "strangers" who visited him earlier, right after he was circumcised).

## Scripture: Genesis 22:2-8 NASB
He said, “Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.” So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and  took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance. Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.” Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on together. Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” Abraham said, “God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” So the two of them walked on together.

### Comments
Found it so cool how the idea of these passages parallel the parsha in Tzav - when you worship God (the way HE wants to be worshipped), it's not about the offering, it's about the one who's offering.
